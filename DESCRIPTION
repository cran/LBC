Description: The logistic Box-Cox model is a formal method, which can accommodate the non-linear 
              relationship between the log-odds and exposure via a shape parameter. Thus, it is 
              superior to the common two-step approach, which adds a data transformation step 
              before fitting a logistic regression model to accommodate any non-linearity in the 
              disease-exposure relationship. This package includes key functions in our model and 
              dataset for simulation. Simulation experiments can be reproduced following the Vignette.
